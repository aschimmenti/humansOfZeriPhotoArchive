# Humans Of Zeri Photo Archive
The Humans of Zeri Photo Archive project has been realised for the Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling exam held by Professor Marilena Daquino, within the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge course at the University of Bologna.

The general aim of the project is to investigate topics related to the field of art history, exploiting linked open data as much as possible and making use of the information available on the ARTchives project and other data-driven realities such as Wikidata.

Specifically, our study focused on expanding the data available on ARTchives about the Zeri Photo Library, integrating it with information about its photographers, in aim of improving research on the study of art photography. We modeled our project in order to be applicable to other collections within ARTchives, with the aim of improving the representation of the content of large collections through the data visualizations.
